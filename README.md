- **Prompt Combination**: Stack multiple quick prompts to create detailed editing instructions
- **Custom Prompts**: Fully customize editing instructions for each image
- **Empty Prompt Handling**: Intelligent detection and skipping of images with empty prompts

### Result Handling
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: View original and edited images together
- **Individual Downloads**: Download any single edited image
- **Batch Downloads**: Create and download a ZIP file with all edited images
- **Export Results**: Save processing details in JSON or text format

6. Click "Deploy!"

### Option 2: Hugging Face Spaces (Free with GPU)

1. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Create a new Space and select "Streamlit" as the SDK
3. Push your code to the Space's repository
4. Add your OpenAI API key in the Space's settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Repository secrets
   - Add a new secret: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key as the value

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health

ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

2. Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t batch-image-creator .
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here batch-image-creator
```

3. Deploy the container to your preferred cloud provider (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, etc.)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Or set them in your deployment platform's environment settings.

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000

3. Upload images through the sidebar interface or load from a local directory

4. For each image:
   - Create an editing prompt or use the quick prompts
   - Click "Edit This Image" to process individually, or
   - Use "Edit All Images" to process all images at once

5. View results and download edited images individually or in bulk

## Available Quick Prompts

The application comes with several preset prompts specifically designed for interior photo editing:

- Clear the room of all furniture
- Clear the room of furniture and stage as a modern living room
- Clear the room of furniture and stage as a modern bedroom
- Declutter this room
- Stage as a minimalist space
- Add modern decor

## Resolution Options

Control the output image size by selecting one of these resolution options:

- **Auto** (Recommended) - Automatically selects the best resolution based on the input image's aspect ratio
- **Square format** (1024x1024) - Perfect square format for balanced images
- **Portrait format** (1024x1536) - Taller format for portrait-oriented images
- **Landscape format** (1536x1024) - Wider format for landscape-oriented images

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI API key with access to the GPT Image-1 model
- Internet connection for API access
- Streamlit 1.10+
- Pillow (PIL)
- zipfile36

## Technical Details

This application uses:
- **OpenAI GPT Image-1**: Advanced AI model for image editing (transformation, manipulation)
